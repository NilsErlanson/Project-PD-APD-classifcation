# Project-Alz-Dectetion
Repository for the project, detecting brain diseases. This project was limited due the small amount amount data, therefore many of the implemented solutions are built around the number of data points in the project.

The repository contains a executable training file

## Requirements
 To run the training file one needs to have data sorted in a folder with the ecat files and corresponding csv file. 
 
 
 write an email to Andreas Lycksam if you want the correct format for the data
